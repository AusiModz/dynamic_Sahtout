<div>This IS an ALTERED version of SahtoutCMS but only in regard to what we can call accessability. The default forcing of file and database structure goes against every thing i want or need for my own project requirements this simply makes it more suited since the database and directory structure is not forced.
Download the files to wherever you want and put in whatever folder you want, name your database tables what you want other than that follow default instructions for install.</div>
